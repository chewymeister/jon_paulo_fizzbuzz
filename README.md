#FizzBuzz

Week 2 Makers Academy

##Our first ruby exercise.

Week 2 of the Makers Academy programme requires us to build our first ruby programme that implements the childhood classic, FizzBuzz.
Here are the rules:

Playing this game with a group of people, you have to take it in turns to count starting from 1.
Everytime you reach a number that is divisble by 3, you shout "Fizz!"
Everytime you reach a number that is divisible by 5, you shout "Buzz!"
Everytime you reach a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, you shout "FizzBuzz!"

The game reaches a climax when a person either stutters for too long or says the wrong keyword. 

This game can be emulated into a simple ruby programme. 
The programme has a single method that takes a number of the user's choice as an argument
The programme will then say Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or just return the number accordingly.

###Technologies learned
Ruby - Learned to created and call methods, create variables, print feeback to the user.

Rspec - Be introduced to the concept of TDD, learn basic Rspec syntax to pass the expectations of FizzBuzz
